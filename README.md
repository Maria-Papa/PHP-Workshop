## ‚úÖ Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Docker Desktop**: [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- **WSL2:** [Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (required for Windows users)
- **Make** (optional, but highly recommended):
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y make
    ```


## ‚ö†Ô∏è AI Assistance Disclaimer
This project was created collaboratively with the help of AI assistants like ChatGPT and Google Gemini.

AI assistance was used for:
- Structuring this README
- Designing Docker, Nginx, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB integration
- Building the Makefile for convenience
- Scoping workshop exercises around backend interview prep (SOLID, design patterns, testing, services)

The technical vision and goals are shaped by the author's experience and preparation needs.


## üèóÔ∏è Workshop Structure: Master vs. Solution
- **`master` branch** ‚Äî Your starting point. Minimal but complete Laravel setup using Docker. Build everything step-by-step.
- **`solution` branch** ‚Äî A complete implementation. Use it to compare, debug, or get unstuck.


## üöÄ Getting Started (Your Workshop Journey)
Follow these steps to set up your workshop environment and start coding:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Maria-Papa/PHP-Workshop.git
cd PHP-Workshop
```

### 2. Copy Environment Configuration
Copy the example environment file so Docker and Laravel have the necessary environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.docker.example .env.docker
```
Set the env variables `UID` and `GID`.

### 3. Start the Docker Compose Services
This command will build the PHP-FPM image (including necessary extensions and Composer), then start all services: Nginx, PHP-FPM, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis.

> **Note:** Run the `make` commands from the **project root directory**.  
> Run the `docker-compose` commands from the **`docker/` directory**.

```bash
make start
# or
docker-compose up --build -d
```

> The first time you run this, it may take several minutes while Docker downloads base images and builds your containers.

### 4. Laravel Setup
Generate the application key:

> **Note:** Run the `make` commands from the **project root directory**.  
> Run the `docker-compose` commands from the **`docker/` directory**.

```bash
make keygen
# or
docker-compose exec app php artisan key:generate
```
Run migrations:
```bash
make migrate
# or
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate --force
```

### 5. View the App
Open your browser:
```
http://localhost
```
You should see the default Laravel welcome page!


## üßë‚Äçüíª Continuing the Workshop
You're all set to start the hands-on workshop exercises!

The workshop is structured into **phases**, each located in the [`workshop_docs/`](./workshop_docs/) folder. These Markdown files (`phase_0.md`, `phase_1.md`, etc.) will guide you through implementing features step-by-step using real backend concepts.

Each phase includes:
- Clear learning objectives.
- Practical tasks to perform in your Laravel codebase.
- Optional challenges and reflections.

> üí° **Tip:** As you complete each phase, follow the navigation links at the bottom of each file to move to the next phase.

Once you‚Äôve read the instructions in a phase, go back to your Laravel project and implement the tasks described.

> üîÅ **Remember:** Commit your changes regularly to your `master` branch to keep track of your progress and ensure you don‚Äôt lose work.


### ‚úÖ Switching to the Solution Branch
To see a fully implemented example:
```bash
git checkout solution
```
When switching branches, you may need to re-install dependencies:
```bash
docker-compose exec app composer install
docker-compose exec app npm install
```
