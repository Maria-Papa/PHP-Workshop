## Phase 4: Interview-Specific Scenarios & Discussions

**Objective:** Prepare for common interview questions related to the keywords, leveraging your project experience.

**Keywords Targeted:** Communication, Collaboration, Problem Solver, Analytical Skills, Self-motivated, Urgency and Ownership, Learning Agility, AWS, Open Source.

### Instructions
1. **Code Review Simulation:**
    - Imagine you are reviewing your own code from Phase 1 or 2.
    - What would you look for? (e.g., adherence to SOLID, testability, performance bottlenecks, error handling, code readability, security).
    - How would you give constructive feedback?
2. **Scalability Brainstorming:**
    - Given your current architecture, how would you scale this application to handle millions of users and thousands of orders per minute?
    - Consider: Database sharding/replication, load balancing, CDN, message queues for asynchronous processing, background jobs, horizontal scaling of PHP/Python services.
3. **High-Level AWS Deployment:**
    - Sketch out a high-level AWS architecture diagram for your platform.
    - Which AWS services would you use for each component (PHP app, Python app, Postgres, MongoDB, Redis, Nginx, Load Balancer)? (e.g., EC2, RDS, ElastiCache, S3, API Gateway, ALB).
    - Explain your choices.
4. **Problem Solving & Analytical Skills:**
    - "An unexpected surge in orders is causing database timeouts. Describe your immediate steps to diagnose and mitigate the issue, and then your long-term solutions."
    - "You need to add a new feature: allowing users to search for restaurants based on complex filters (cuisine, delivery time, rating). How would you design this efficiently, considering performance?"
5. **Behavioral & Cultural Fit:**
    - "Tell me about a challenging technical problem you faced and how you solved it. What did you learn?" (Relate to your project or past experience)
    - "How do you stay updated with new technologies and best practices in the PHP ecosystem?"
    - "How do you approach working in an Agile team?"
    - "Why {insert_company_name_here}? What excites you about this role and our company?" (Connect to their company description).

### Self-Check/Reflection
- Can you articulate your design choices and defend them?
- Are you comfortable discussing trade-offs in architecture (e.g., monolith vs. microservices, synchronous vs. asynchronous)?
- Have you prepared concise answers for common behavioral questions, linking them to your experience and the {insert_company_name_here} values?
